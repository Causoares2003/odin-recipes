    <h2>Here is a summary of a cheese pizza recipe:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To make the dough, mix together 7g of yeast and 1 tsp of sugar with 250ml of warm water and leave<br>
            for 10 minutes. Then add 400g of flour and 2 tbsp of olive oil and knead to a smooth dough. Leave to<br>rise for an hour or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>To make the sauce, heat some oil in a pan and cook a chopped onion and garlic clove until soft.<br> 
            Then add a can of chopped tomatoes, some oregano, salt and pepper and simmer for 15 minutes or<br>
            until thickened.</li>
        <li>To assemble the pizza, divide the dough into two balls and roll out each one on a floured surface.<br>
            Place them on baking sheets and spread some sauce over them. Sprinkle with grated mozzarella<br>
            cheese and sliced cherry tomatoes. Drizzle with some more olive oil and season with salt<br>
